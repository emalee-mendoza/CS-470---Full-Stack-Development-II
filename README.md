## Experiences and Strengths

1. What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?
    - Skills that I've learned in this course are related to migrating an application from local storage to cloud services. Prior to this course, I did not know anything about AWS, but now I am familiar with S3, Lambda, DynamoDB, and API Gateway. I mastered the ability to fully immerse myself in unfamiliar services, get to know them, and create a well rounded project from what I learned. I feel very accomplished to have learned about AWS, as I know this knowledge will be useful in my career.
  
2. Describe your strengths as a software developer.
   - My greatest strengths are adaptability and attention to detail. I aim to keep to an open mind and remain flexible when learning a new skill. This has helped me throughtout my time in the computer science program since I'm essentially learning a completely new concept for every eight week term. I think my attention to detail is valuable because it allows me to identify errors in my code and keep my work consistent. 

3. Identify the types of roles you are prepared to assume in a new job.
   - I'm prepared to assume the role of tester, developer, and QA analyst. In this course and others, I learned the value of creating tests for an application and this is something that I've enjoyed. I've learned to devlop code in Python, Java, and C++. I've developed everything from text-based games to 3D scenes to full stack web applications. Something that interests me is being the person that reviews code to make sure it meets the quality standards.

## Planning For Growth

1. Identify various ways that microservices or serverless may be used to produce efficiencies of management and scale in your web application in the future.
   - Serverless can provide me with effectiveness of management and scale in future web applications because it is accessible. As a new developer, I do not have the skills or knowledge to manage a whole application infrastructure by myself. Utilizing microservices can take all that burden away and allow me to focus on developing my product. 
  
2. Explain several pros and cons that would be deciding factors in plans for expansion.
   - Pros are cost effectiveness for short run times, scalability, and security. Cons are loss of total control, expensive for long run times, and application performance problems.

3. What roles do elasticity and pay-for-service play in decision making for planned future growth?
   - Elasticity is an important feature of cloud computing. This refers to the property of the cloud that allows it to dynamically and effectively grow or shrink capacity for resources to meet the changing demands of the application or organization.  This feature is appealing to developers because it allows for almost seamless growth for their application with decreased overhead costs and increased accessibility.
The pay-per-use model is another appealing feature of cloud computing. From companies that are just starting out to those that do not wish to have the added pressure of maintaining infrastructure, this model allows them to use the services as needed and as little as required.
